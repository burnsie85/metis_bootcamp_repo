# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Back Story

An email from a potential client:

> Vinny & Joan -
>
> It was great to meet with you and chat at the event where we recently met and had a nice chat. We’d love to take some next steps to see if working together is something that would make sense for both parties.
>
> As we mentioned, we are interested in harnessing the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of our street team work, which is a significant portion of our fundraising efforts.
>
> WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala in New York City at the beginning of the fall each year. As we are new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.
>
> To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.
>
> Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to use MTA subway data, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to help us optimize the placement of our street teams, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.
>
> The ball is in your court now—do you think this is something that would be feasible for your group? From there we can explore what kind of an engagement would make sense for all of us.
>
> Best,
>
> Karrine and Dahlia
>
> WTWY International

## Data:

 * MTA Turnstile Data (Google it!)
 * Additional data sources welcome!
  
## Skills:

 * `python` and `pandas`
 * visualizations via Matplotlib & seaborn

## Analysis:

 * Exploratory Data Analysis
 * The [01-mta challenge](https://github.com/thisismetis/onl20_ds4/tree/master/challenges/challenges_questions/01-mta) will help you get started with your data exploration and get you up to speed with the skills and tools you need to complete this project.

## Deliverable/Communication:

 * Group presentation, 6 minutes (3-4 people per)
 * Organized project repository

**Friday 9/25:** You will have the hour before presentations start to submit a PDF of your presentation through the student submissions form and practice as a group (see [these](https://github.com/thisismetis/onl20_ds4/blob/master/curriculum/project-01/git-1/submissions.md) instructions). Presentations should be focused on the client, no longer than 6 minutes, and everyone needs to talk.
**Monday 9/28:** Code submission is due before in the morning before class starts. Include code and README file.

As with all projects, it will be graded based on this [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oAJrWNR7HxNJVI2IHUuHArEvBccowLqvPObYbqtH0rs/edit).  
We are very excited to see what you will learn and do for Project 1!
